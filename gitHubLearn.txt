GitHub offers several advanced features that help with collaboration, automation, security, and project management. Here are some key ones:

🚀 1️⃣ GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
🔹 Automate workflows like testing, building, and deploying applications.
🔹 Example: Automatically deploy a Node.js app after a commit.

Example GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Deploy Application

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to server
        run: echo "Deploying application..."
✅ Automates testing, builds, and deployments.

🔐 2️⃣ GitHub Security Features
🔹 Code Scanning – Detect vulnerabilities in your code.
🔹 Dependabot – Alerts for security issues in dependencies.
🔹 Secret Scanning – Detects API keys, passwords, or credentials in the repo.

✅ Ensures secure code and updates dependencies automatically.

👥 3️⃣ GitHub Projects & Issues
🔹 Project Boards – Kanban-style project management.
🔹 Issues & Labels – Track and categorize bugs, features, or enhancements.
🔹 Discussions – Community-driven Q&A within the repository.

✅ Helps manage team collaboration.

🌎 4️⃣ GitHub Codespaces
🔹 Cloud-based development environment.
🔹 Provides a VS Code-like interface in the browser.
🔹 Pre-configured with dependencies and Docker support.

✅ No need to set up a local development environment.

📦 5️⃣ GitHub Packages
🔹 Host and distribute container images, npm packages, and more.
🔹 Supports Docker, npm, Maven, and NuGet.

✅ Useful for managing internal libraries.

🔄 6️⃣ GitHub API & Webhooks
🔹 Integrate GitHub with external apps and services.
🔹 Automate workflows using REST & GraphQL APIs.

Example: Create an issue using GitHub API

sh
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"title": "New Issue", "body": "Issue details"}' \
     https://api.github.com/repos/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/issues
✅ Automates GitHub interactions programmatically.

📂 7️⃣ Git Large File Storage (LFS)
🔹 Handles large files like videos, datasets, and binary assets efficiently.
🔹 Reduces repository size and improves performance.

✅ Useful for ML/DL projects, game assets, and large media files.

🚀 8️⃣ GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface)
🔹 Manage repositories, pull requests, and issues directly from the terminal.

Example: Create a new repository from CLI

sh
Copy
Edit
gh repo create my-project --public --source=.
✅ Speeds up GitHub actions without using the web interface.
